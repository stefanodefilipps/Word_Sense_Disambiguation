# Word_Sense_Disambiguation
Implementation of different neural networks model in order to solve the Word Sense Disambiguation Task both in the fine grained and coarse grained case.
The model implemented were:

* BLSTM with Elmo for embedding Layer

* BLSTM with Elmo for embedding Layer + Attention Mechanism (Simple and Bahdanau)

* BLSTM with Elmo for embedding Layer + Attention Mechanism (Simple and Bahdanau) + MultiLearning

* BLSTM with Elmo for embedding Layer + Attention Mechanism (Simple and Bahdanau) + Hierarchical MultiLearning
